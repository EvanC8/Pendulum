# Pendulum Simulation
Welcome to my project! This simulation uses Euler Integration to approximate the motion of a pendulum.
Aspects of the pendulum can be altered to influence its movement, including its length, angle, and the gravitational constant of the scene.
Graphics are drawn using p5.js.
I hope you enjoy!

I plan to test the simulation with other algorithms including the Runge-Kutta Integration and Verlet Integration to further improve the accuracy of the simulation.
